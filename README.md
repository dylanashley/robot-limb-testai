# robot-limb-testai

This repository tests the robot's capabilities to perform contemporary artificial intelligence experiments. The important files contained herein are
- a main file (`run.py`), which runs the experiment;
- a plotting file (`plot.py`), which was used to generate the plots shown in the paper;
- a statistical test file (`test.py`), which was used to determine the significance of the experimental results; and
- three configuration files (`ac.yml`, `brownian.yml`, and `ppo.yml`), which contain the specific configurations of the experiments.
